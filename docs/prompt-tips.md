# Creating Effective Prompts for Hostinger Horizons

This guide outlines a methodical five-part structure for creating optimal prompts that will help you get the most out of Hostinger Horizons' AI-powered web application development capabilities.

## Why Structured Prompts Matter

The quality of your prompts directly determines the quality of the web application or SaaS product Hostinger Horizons generates. Following this structured approach allows you to:

- Create complete applications with minimal prompts (2-3 prompts can build an entire application)
- Maximize your monthly prompt allowance (500 prompts in the recommended package)
- Achieve professional-quality results consistently
- Avoid common errors and incomplete implementations

## The Five-Part Prompt Structure

### 1. Brand Identity

This first component establishes your application's identity and personality:

- **Application Name**: The official name of your application
- **Visual Identity**: The overall look and feel
- **Color Scheme**: Primary and secondary colors for the application
- **Typography**: Font styles and text presentation
- **Logo**: Description or reference to the application's logo
- **Style**: Whether it's minimalist, corporate, playful, etc.
- **Tone**: Whether the application should feel professional, casual, friendly, etc.

When Hostinger knows your brand character from the beginning, it automatically builds the right design elements throughout your application.

### 2. Objective

This component articulates the purpose and goals of your application:

- **Problem Solved**: What issue or challenge the application addresses
- **Target Audience**: Who will use this application
- **Value Proposition**: How the application benefits users
- **End Goals**: What users should achieve with the application

This section is crucial because it helps Hostinger's AI understand the context and purpose of your application. Hostinger's AI is specifically oriented toward SaaS and web applications, enabling it to develop functionalities you haven't explicitly requested but that are essential for your application type.

Unlike other AI code editors, Hostinger can infer basic functionalities even if you don't specify them, provided you clearly define the objectives.

### 3. Main Features

This component lists the primary functionalities of your application:

- List as bullet points
- Focus on primary/essential features
- No need to go into implementation details
- Present in order of importance

It's recommended not to overload this section with detailed specifications. Instead, provide a clear list of the core features, and Hostinger will develop them appropriately.

### 4. Menu Structure (Optional)

This component outlines the navigation structure of your application:

- Main navigation items
- Sub-menus if applicable
- Information architecture

While optional, this section is important if your application needs specific navigation patterns. Importantly, Hostinger doesn't just display the menu but develops the corresponding pages from the first promptâ€”a significant advantage over other AI code editors.

### 5. Interface Preferences

This final component details specific UI/UX requirements:

- **Design Style**: Modern, classic, minimalist, etc.
- **Navigation Style**: How users move through the application
- **Accessibility Features**: Such as dark mode, text sizing options
- **Layout Preferences**: Grid-based, card-based, etc.
- **Responsive Design Requirements**: How the application should behave on different devices

This section ensures that Hostinger builds an interface that matches your vision and requirements.

## Best Practices for Implementation

1. **Request each new feature in separate prompts** rather than overloading a single prompt with too many features, which could lead to errors or incomplete implementation.

2. **Use the step-by-step approach**:
   - Start with a comprehensive initial prompt using the five-part structure
   - Add premium features in subsequent prompts (e.g., subscription features, payment integration)
   - Finally, incorporate user authentication and team management features

3. **Include a "final note"** instructing Hostinger not to stop until all functionalities are operational.

4. **Consider language preferences** - Hostinger Horizons works with multiple languages including English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese.

## Pro Tip: Using the GPT Tool for Prompt Generation

There's a free GPT tool specifically designed to generate these structured prompts for Hostinger Horizons that works in two ways:

1. **Idea-Based Prompts**
   - You provide your application idea
   - The GPT analyzes it and creates a fully structured prompt
   - It formulates all five components automatically
   - The generated prompt can be copied directly into Hostinger Horizons

2. **Inspiration-Based Prompts**
   - You provide a URL of an existing website that inspires you
   - The GPT analyzes the site's features, structure, and design
   - It creates a prompt that would generate a similar (but not identical) application
   - You can then customize aspects before submitting to Hostinger

This tool serves as an intermediary step to ensure your prompts follow the optimal structure without requiring you to master prompt engineering from scratch.
